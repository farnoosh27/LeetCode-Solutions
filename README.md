# LeetCode-Solutions
Interview preparation requires excellent skills in live coding, and in this respository, I am planning to write about all the questions and answers that I read in order to prepare for the technical interviews.
I'm also trying to provide useful explanations for each solution so as to make it easy for the folks who want to read this repository for interview preparation!

* As you may have guessed, the naming format for each file in this "LeetCode_Solutions" repository is: questionnumber_questiontitle
* For each problem, I have tried to mention the difficulty level and the main topic they are about (array, strings, linked list, maps, recursion, sorting, etc)
