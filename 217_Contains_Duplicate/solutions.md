## Question

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]

Output: true

## Solution
This is a beginner question, and has a lot of solutions:

1) brute force solution would exist, which requires O(n*n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
2) Sorting and checkig for adjacent values, time complexity of this would be O(nlogn) space complexity O(1). 
3) using Hashmap 
4)
